    Optimizes storage usage, i.e. deletes some files and returns new storage usage statistics. Secret thumbnails can't be deleted

        size (:obj:`int`):
            Limit on the total size of files after deletion, in bytesPass -1 to use the default limit
        ttl (:obj:`int`):
            Limit on the time that has passed since the last time a file was accessed (or creation time for some filesystems)Pass -1 to use the default limit

            Limit on the total number of files after deletionPass -1 to use the default limit
        immunity_delay (:obj:`int`):

        return_deleted_file_statistics (:obj:`bool`):
            Pass true if statistics about the files that were deleted must be returned instead of the whole storage usage statisticsAffects only returned statistics
        chat_limit (:obj:`int`):
            Same as in getStorageStatisticsAffects only returned statistics
